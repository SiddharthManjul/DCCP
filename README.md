# Distributed Communication Channel Protocol (DCCP)

## 📘 Overview

This repository explores how [libp2p](https://libp2p.io) is used to build the **Distributed Communication Channel Protocol (DCCP)** — a system that enables secure, censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer communication without relying on centralized infrastructure.

## 🧩 1. Why libp2p Is Necessary for DCCP

**DCCP** enables **peer-to-peer** communication that is:

- End-to-end encrypted  
- Censorship-resistant  
- Metadata-minimizing  
- Interoperable across devices  
- Resilient to network interruptions  

To meet these goals, a system must allow peers to:

- Discover each other without DNS or central directories  
- Establish secure, authenticated channels  
- Traverse NATs/firewalls  
- Communicate even in adverse networks  
- Avoid centralized relay dependencies  

### ❗️ Without libp2p, we would need to manually build:

- Transport layer (TCP/UDP/WebRTC/etc.)  
- NAT traversal and relaying  
- Encryption and identity system  
- Peer discovery and addressing  
- Messaging protocols  

Using **libp2p** provides a modular, extensible, and production-ready P2P stack that saves months of engineering and ensures higher reliability.

## ⚙️ 2. How We Are Going to Use libp2p for DCCP

### 2.1 Peer Identity

Each DCCP node gets a **libp2p Peer ID** derived from its cryptographic keypair.

- Used to uniquely identify a peer  
- Authenticates and signs messages  
- Enables encrypted private communication  

---

### 2.2 Peer Discovery

Peers can discover each other through:

- **Bootstrap Nodes** – Initial known peers  
- **mDNS** – Local network peer discovery  
- **DHT** – Wide-area decentralized peer lookup  

---

### 2.3 Transport Layer

libp2p handles transport negotiation across:

- **TCP** – Default for desktop/server nodes  
- **WebRTC** – Browser and mobile support  
- **QUIC** – High-speed, low-latency transport  
- **WebSockets** – For compatibility behind firewalls  

---

### 2.4 Secure Communication

libp2p uses **Noise** or **TLS** for:

- End-to-end encryption  
- Identity authentication  
- Session key generation  

Every message is:

- Encrypted with the receiver’s public key  
- Signed with the sender’s private key  

---

### 2.5 NAT Traversal and Relaying

To support devices behind NATs/firewalls:

- **AutoNAT** – Detects NAT type  
- **Hole Punching** – Direct peer connection attempts  
- **Circuit Relay v2** – Relay through public peers  

---

### 2.6 PubSub (Optional)

For group messaging or broadcast use cases, libp2p offers **Gossipsub**:

- Topic-based PubSub  
- Spam control via peer scoring  
- Efficient message propagation

| Component            | Role in DCCP                                                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Peer ID**          | Identity and message authentication                         |
| **Transports**       | TCP, WebRTC, QUIC, WebSockets – multi-device connectivity   |
| **Encryption**       | Noise/TLS for secure channels                               |
| **NAT Traversal**    | AutoNAT, hole punching, circuit relays                      |
| **Peer Discovery**   | mDNS, Bootstrap nodes, DHT for locating peers               |
| **Multiplexing**     | Yamux/Mplex for multiple streams per connection             |
| **PubSub (Optional)**| Gossipsub for broadcast or group chat scenarios             |

## ✅ Conclusion

**libp2p** is the foundation of a truly decentralized communication infrastructure like DCCP. It solves the most complex parts of peer-to-peer systems—identity, transport, NAT traversal, encryption, and more—so we can focus on building the application layer.

This repo serves as both a reference and a starting point for implementing decentralized messaging, file-sharing, or metadata-private communication tools using libp2p and DCCP.

# 🛰️ DCCP — Distributed Communication Channel Protocol (Go Implementation)

DCCP is a protocol for building secure, censorship-resistant, decentralized communication channels using [libp2p](https://libp2p.io/). This reference implementation in Go enables any two or more peers to establish end-to-end encrypted streams without relying on centralized infrastructure like servers, DNS, or cloud relays.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ **Peer-to-peer** (no servers)
- 🔐 **End-to-end encryption**
- 🌐 **NAT traversal** support
- 🧭 **Local peer discovery** (mDNS)
- 📄 **Self-sovereign identities** (libp2p keys)
- 🧩 **Modular design**

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
Each DCCP peer:
1. Generates a libp2p identity (`PeerID`)
2. Listens on multiple transports (TCP/WebSocket)
3. Discovers peers via mDNS
4. Establishes secure streams using `/dccp/1.0.0` protocol

## go
// Simplified flow
peer := libp2p.New()
peer.SetStreamHandler("/dccp/1.0.0", handleStream)
mdns.NewMdnsService(peer, "dccp-mdns").Start()
